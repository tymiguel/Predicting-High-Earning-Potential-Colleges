# Predicting-High-Earning-Potential-Colleges

This repo contains analysis which uses the 2015 College Scorecard data to predict the earning potential of 4-year universities in the US. THe universities are slotted into 3 categories, low-, medium-, and high-earning potentential universities.

This analysis relies heavily on the Data Mining with R package (`DMwR`) which is used to build our learning systems and compare to see which system will be the best for predicting the class of each institution.

The .Rdata files contant the outputs after running 4 different learning systems. Each data file is used throughout the analysis.

The RMD and HTML file are the final files which walk through the analysis.

Note: The data file is extracted from the US Department if Education website. (https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/)
